# Sample Code: Movies

This repository contains sample code. 

Its purpose being, to quickly demonstrate Android, Kotlin and software development in general. More so and amongst others, 
the main focus of this project is:
- Setup and Gradle configuration, 
- Gradle modules,
- Clean architecture,
- Clean code,
- Best practices,
- Testing and 
- All those other must know goodies.

Below is a list of goodies that are being showcased:

1. Architectural Patterns
    1. [Modularization](https://medium.com/google-developer-experts/modularizing-android-applications-9e2d18f244a0) 
    ```(Modularize the App Horizontally by Features)```

    3. [Clean Architecture](https://8thlight.com/blog/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html) ```(By employing 
    clean architecture, you can design applications with very low coupling and independent of technical implementation 
    details, such as databases and frameworks. That way, the application becomes easy to maintain and flexible to change. 
    It also becomes intrinsically testable.)```

# Usage

The first thing that you need to do in order to be able to build and run this project is to locate the 'local.properties' 
file (and if it doesn't exist, create it). Then, add the following properties:
```
# Gradle
gradle.ignored.variants=release
# The Movie Database (TMDb)
themoviedb.api.key=<YOUR.THEMOVIEDB.API.KEY>
```

For more information on how to configure Gradle for use with GitHub Packages visit
[Configuring Gradle for use with GitHub Packages](https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-gradle-for-use-with-github-packages).

For more information on how to configure the Gradle ignored variants read the specific 'Build Variant' section below.

For more information on how to obtain your personal TMDB api key visit  
[The Movie Database API (v3)](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction).

# Build Variant

This project is setup in a way that can be configured to filter out on demand specific build variants by just specifying the 
'ignored_variants' property, which is located within the 'local.properties' file. If no configuration is specified, then the 
default configuration will be applied, which is all build types and flavors.

Add the 'gradle.ignored.variants' property and assign that to a value. This value can be a single variant value, such as the 
'release' built type or a comma separated list of variant values, such as 'debug,release,etc'. Any variant that goes in 
there will be then filtered out by the build.
```
This is mainly done in order to speed up build times and complexity during development, thus making developers happier since 
in most cases developers usually only care about the 'debug' build type (and a single build flavor, if that is even available).
```

# Building The Project

All set, use the below command to build the project in order to install it on an Android device for demonstration:
```
gradlew clean build -x check
```

Or faster yet and targeting a specific build type (in our case the debug build type):
```
gradlew clean assembleDebug
```

Open an emulator or connect a physical device to experiment with the sample app, use the below command, which first 
uninstalls and then installs the sample app:
```
gradlew uninstallDebug | gradlew installDebug
```

Or faster yet, target a specific device (in our case an emulator):
```
adb -s emulator-5554 uninstall io.petros.movies | 
adb -s emulator-5554 install app\build\outputs\apk\debug\app-debug.apk
```

Use this command in order to run the static code analysis for the project:
```
gradlew check -x test
```

Or if you want to be more specific, run the below commands to run the code quality tool or your choice (in isolation):
```
gradlew detekt
gradlew lintDebug
```

Run the project unit tests using this command (this includes Robolectric):
```
gradlew test
```

There might be a possibility that you encounter a Java version related problem while having the Robolectric tests run. In 
that case, first run 'java -version' and check the Java version on your machine. Them, you might end up needing to upgrade 
or downgrade your Java version to be able to run the Robolectric tests. This is a Robolectric's specific problem, which 
should get fixed in subsequent Robolectric releases.

Now, if you want to be more specific, run the below commands to run the tests or your choice (per module):
```
gradlew <kotlin_module>:test
gradlew <android_module>:testDebugUnitTest
```

Run the project instrumentation tests using this command (Espresso):
```
gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

In order to run successfully the instrumentation tests and avoid flakiness, you need to turn off system animations on the 
device used for testing. To do so, on your device, under 'Settings -> Developer options', disable the following 3 settings 
within the 'DRAWING' section:
- Window animation scale
- Transition animation scale
- Animator duration scale

Now, if you want to be more specific, run the below command to run the instrumentation tests or your choice (for app module):
```
gradlew app:connectedDebugAndroidTest
```

Run the project coverage reports using this command:
```
gradlew coverage
```

Or if you want to just run the Jacoco reports without comparing the results with each other, use the below command:
```
gradlew jacoco
```

If you feel like it you can also unleash the 'monkey' and stress test the app with some random instructions (10K of them
should do it), use the below command:
```
adb shell monkey -p io.petros.movies.debug -v 10000
```

Use this command in order to check dependency updates for the project:
```
gradlew dependencyUpdates
```

Run the project dependency analysis reports using this command:
```
gradlew buildHealth
gradlew ripples --id :app
```

Run the project module graph assert reports using this command:
```
gradlew assertModuleGraph
```

And if you feel like it you can also generate 'Graphviz' files to visualise the modularization result, see below commands:
```
gradlew generateModulesGraphvizText -Pmodules.graph.print.statistics=true (command line visualization)
gradlew generateModulesGraphvizText -Pmodules.graph.output.gv=module_graph_assert (file output for Graphviz visualization)
dot -T png modules_graph -O (convert the above generated .dot file to a .png file, you need to install Graphviz first)
```
